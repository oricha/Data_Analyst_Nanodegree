    "In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example<font color=\"red\"> RED</font>, <font color=\"blue\">BLUE</font>. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example<font color=\"green\"> PURPLE</font>,<font color=\"gray\"> ORANGE</font>. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition."
